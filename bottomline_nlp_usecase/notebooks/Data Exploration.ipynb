I see over the past few days you've run into some problems with copyright in an article you wrote, and appear to have deleted your user page and asked for your account to be deactivated.  \\n\\nI hope you don't decide to abandon Wikipedia all together over this.  I would like to try to help you understand what Wikipedia is about, and the reasoning behind various rules, and concepts such as copyright (which is a legal concept that Wikipedia must respect).  If and when you come back, feel free to talk to me about what happened and what confuses you and I'll try to help you learn how not to run afoul of things like that. ~ ''''(Talk|Contribs)problem solving \"   \n",

       "29000  \"Subsequently Eleland came along and deleted most of your modifications claiming that they were not from authoritative enough sources and that they were disproportionate within the article. Eleland made a unilateral decision about all this and was quite perturbed when I reinstated the article. Eleland proceeded to get into a deletion war, would not entertain discussion prior to making wholesale deletions, and then contacted administration to have the sections struck out. Please check discussion for Admin's response. I do not question anything said by Manning, however it does not appear that he has looked at the sources as thoroughly as Fluri. Also Eleland placed warnings on the article regarding the veracity of the citations.\\n\\nAdmittedly, I have responded vigorously in discussion, but only to protect the material that had already been checked by Fluri. Anyway it appears that Eleland is on a messianic crusade to have it struck off the record. This is somewhat surprising given Eleland's herculean efforts ...   \n",

I was merely commenting on his color. He's not as light as most Mediterraneans, but he's around the skin tone of the stereotypical Mediterranean (i.e. very tanned skin color). There are Ethiopians who are as light or lighter than him, but they are very few in number, so I wouldn't say that he's darker than \"\"a lot\"\" of Ethiopians. I would put those at or around his skin color at 10% tops, with those lighter than him much less than that. However, the pictures that you linked to seem to have bad lighting, which is why he appears darker than in other shots. If you look here, for example, you'll see that he's not actually that dark. He is, however, darker than most Mediterraneans. There are, however, many Egyptians who are darker than him and closer to Sadat's skin color.\\n\\n (Yom) | contribs • Talk \\n\\n\"   \n",

       "24956  You are involved in the cult of Wikipedia- this brings you into a feud with all right thinking people.  I am not insulting Gronowksi- he is stalking Murphy, he is 16 years old, his arguments do lack intelligence.  I do not have to be kind with an idiot.  The fact that I am STILL BORN doesn't mean anything.  I'd change it to Dickhead- it is just a handle and has no meaning - it was referring toe the fact that the cult has banned me virtually everyday since November and yet I am back again within a day.

In the case of lead in water, the bouyant force is equal to the weight of the water volume displaced - which is far less than the weight of the lead, and the lead sinks. And mountains do sink into the mantle until the buoyant force (equal to the weight of the displaced mantle volume) equals the weight of the mountain.   \n",

Did you mean to call it Aba Women's war or did you mean to use riot, because if you meant the former we still need a source that uses that name?174.93.163.194   \n",

The removal of a warning is taken as evidence that the warning has been read by the user. Deleted warnings can still be found in the page history. Repeatedly replacing warnings does nothing but antagonize users, and can encourage further disruption; removal of template warnings is rarely an urgent or important matter, and it is often best to simply let the matter rest if other disruption stops.\\n\\nI promise other distruption is stopped.

Just because something is verifiable does not mean we should publish it - verifiability is merely a prerequisite for inclusion, not a guarantee.  In this instance I can't see what it adds to an article not relevant to socialism to include the views of a socialist publication.  If the argument is that it's not because it's a socialist publication then this critic is on par with any other random magazine critic and is superfluous.

Factual accuracy - 'mostly' implies a majority, which is not the case. Besides, OpenFutureBoy or whatever the fuck he is called has been behaving like a dick and then getting all uppity when someone calls him on it - it's pretty pathetic to see. As for Wolfowitz, well, he's been getting up people's noses since the dawn of time. You'll note the numerical majority of my edits have been minor, but constructive. I'll continue on that path if you'd prefer. Unblock me, keep me blocked - it's not hugely important but it won't stop me from making little edits (which is what I prefer to do) and occasionally insulting dicks like OpenLegBoy (which someone needs to do).
